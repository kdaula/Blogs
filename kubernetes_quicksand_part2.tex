\subsection{Act II: The Case of the Disappearing Nodes}

You log into your Kubernetes dashboard, expecting to see your familiar list of worker nodes. Instead, half of them are gone. Not just \textit{NotReady}—gone. You frantically check your cloud provider’s dashboard, and there it is: your autoscaler has terminated them. Perfect. It turns out that your autoscaler got a little too aggressive and scaled down production nodes due to a misconfigured resource pressure setting.

Now you’re left scrambling to recover nodes, reschedule workloads, and figure out why your cluster decided to eat itself alive. Here’s a tip for the future: fine-tune your autoscaler settings so it doesn’t treat your production nodes like disposable napkins:

\begin{lstlisting}
spec:
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
\end{lstlisting}

Just when you think you’re in the clear, you realize the autoscaler also nuked your persistent volumes. Time to reinitialize orphaned volumes and get everything back online. Fun times.

\section{Chapter 3: Networking – The Dungeon of Misery}

If you thought Kubernetes networking was going to be a walk in the park, think again. Networking issues in Kubernetes can be like walking blindfolded through a maze while someone throws bricks at you. Services can’t talk to each other, DNS lookups fail for no reason, and network policies block traffic like a paranoid security guard.

\subsection{Act I: CNI Madness}

Your services are down, DNS is failing, and you can’t figure out why your Pods refuse to communicate. Welcome to the CNI nightmare. Your CNI plugin (whether it's Calico, Flannel, or something more exotic) has decided to clash with your infrastructure’s NAT tables, and now all inter-Pod communication is dead in the water.

The first step? Dig into your network configs. Check that your Pod CIDRs and service CIDRs aren’t conflicting, or worse—overlapping. Maybe someone accidentally nuked your network policies:

\begin{lstlisting}
netConfig := client.CoreV1().ConfigMaps("kube-system").Get(context.TODO(), "calico-config", metav1.GetOptions{})
fmt.Printf("Pod CIDR: %s", netConfig.Data["PodCIDR"])
\end{lstlisting}

Still no luck? Time to pull out the packet sniffers and start diagnosing at the packet level. At this point, you’ve essentially become a network engineer, manually tracing packets, and fixing firewall rules you never even knew existed. Welcome to Kubernetes Networking Hell.

\section{Chapter 4: The Scheduler’s Revenge}

Kubernetes promises a smart scheduler that will magically place workloads on the right nodes, ensuring resource efficiency and smooth operations. In reality? The scheduler is more like a temperamental toddler, leaving Pods in Pending for no discernible reason, while resource-heavy jobs sit on nodes that can barely run \textit{htop}.

\subsection{Act I: Taints, Affinities, and Anti-Affinities – The Bermuda Triangle of Scheduling}

Your nodes have plenty of capacity, but Kubernetes refuses to schedule your Pods. The scheduler logs look like they were written by aliens, and you’re left scratching your head. Eventually, you realize the issue: your nodes were tainted during some earlier maintenance, and now your Pods have strict affinity rules that are basically saying, “Nah, we don’t want to run there.”

The solution? Manually remove the taints and comb through your affinity and anti-affinity configurations until the scheduler finally gives in. You’ve spent half a day tweaking YAML, and all you have to show for it is a running Pod and a serious headache.

You think you’ve seen it all with Kubernetes? Think again. The platform is a minefield of hidden nightmares waiting to ruin your day when you least expect it.
